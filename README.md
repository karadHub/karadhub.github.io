Designing reliable cloud platforms and shipping safely at speed. I build cloud-native infrastructure, automated delivery pipelines, and resilient systems that scale.

## Core Expertise

- Cloud infrastructure: GCP, AWS, Azure
- Containers & orchestration: Kubernetes, Docker, OpenShift
- CI/CD engineering: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/EFK, Datadog, New Relic
- SRE: reliability practices, SLIs/SLOs, incident response, capacity planning

## Platforms & Tooling

- Languages: Python, Bash, JavaScript, Go
- Frameworks: Node.js, Express.js
- Datastores: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Build/Quality: Git, Maven, Gradle, SonarQube

## Selected Projects

### Cloud Infrastructure Automation

Provisioned scalable environments using Terraform and Kubernetes with secure by-default networking and secrets management.

- Impact: faster environment bootstrapping, consistent configs, fewer manual changes.

### CI/CD Pipeline Modernization

Re-architected pipelines to enable trunk-based development, parallelized tests, and progressive delivery.

- Impact: up to 70% faster deployments, improved change failure rate, safer rollouts.

### Monitoring & Proactive Alerting

Implemented end-to-end observability with Prometheus and Grafana including golden signals, runbooks, and SLOs.

- Impact: 99.9%+ service availability and faster mean-time-to-detect.

## Outcome Highlights

- 70% reduction in deployment time via CI/CD optimization
- 99.9% uptime achieved through robust monitoring and alerting
- 50% cloud cost savings from rightsizing and automation
- Zero-downtime deployments across multiple environments
